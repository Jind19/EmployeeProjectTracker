# 🏢 Employee Project Tracker

- working with a fictional company that tracks employees and the projects they are working on. 
- Each employee is assigned to a department and works on multiple projects. 
- Each project has a budget and a status ("active" or "completed"). 
- will analyze this data using:

flatMap() — for flattening nested project lists
Built-in Collectors — for grouping, counting, and averaging
A Custom Collector — for summarizing project statistics per department
